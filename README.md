# Rogueday

A roguelike made in ~~one day~~ ~12 hours.

## POST CODE

Hi guys, _post-24-hour-challange Calcopod here_. As you can probably tell, not only is **the code absolutely disgusting**, but it also doesn't even work almost at all.

Still, it did allow me to **learn and experiment** with quite a lot of Odin features and also "randy mega struct C-style game entity architecture", which have to say was pretty fun.

Overall, most design decisions are garbage, and you can tell I learned more about Odin as I went, so **EXPECT A REWRITE SOMETIME SOON**

### "Engine" Features:

-   "Scene" "Management"
-   "UI" "System"
-   "Components"
-   "Tilemaps"
-   AABB "Collision" stuff

### "Gameplay" Features

-   Procedural Generation (Random Walks and CA)
-   Enemy "AI"
-   4 "different" enemies (1 of them is a boss that doesn't do anything)
-   ... that's it, there is 0 game ...
